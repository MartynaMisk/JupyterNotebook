    "numpy.random package is a sub-package of the NumPy package in Python. NumPy biggets advantage is that it perfoms calculation over entire arrays. numpy.random package main purpose is to generate sequence of random numbers, this package contains different functions that allows you to do it. In this Notebook we will focus on how those functions within numpy.random package operate and generate sequence of random numbers. numpy.random uses its own PRNG (Pseudorandom number generator)that is separate from plain old random which I found very interesting. \n"
