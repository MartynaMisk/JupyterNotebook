# Numpy.Random Package
Random sampling (numpy.random) package contains simple random data, permutations, distributions and random generator sections and each contains a number of functions that help us plot and generate random sampling

## Main area of focus:
1. Explanation of the overall purpose of the package. 
2. Explanation of the use of the “Simple random data” and “Permutations” functions.
3. Explanation of the use and purpose of at least five “Distributions” functions.
4. Explanation of the use of seeds in generating pseudorandom numbers.

### Libraries used:
- Numpy
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib

### Simple random data functions:
- np.random.rand
- np.random.randint
- np.random_sample
- np.random.choice

### Permutation functions:
- np.random.shuffle
- np.random.permutation

### Five Distribution used:
- Numpy Random Binomial
- Numpy Random Uniform
- Numpy Random Logistic
- Numpy Random Hypergeometric
- add another one

### Seeds in generating pseudorandom numbers:
Simple explanation of my understanding is that every random funciton runs something similar to an algorythm that generates the output of the random variables. Seeds then is a state/number that initiates this algorythm; gives it the begining and end.
